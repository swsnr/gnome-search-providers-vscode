Supports

- Code OSS (Arch Linux)
- VSCodium
- Visual Studio Code (AUR package)
- Visual Studio Code ([Official packages](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

Under the hood this is a small systemd user service which implements the [search provider][1] DBus API and exposes recent workspaces from VSCode.

## Installation

### Packages & binaries

- [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-search-providers-vscode/)

### From source

Install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then run

```console
$ make build
$ sudo make install
```

This install to `/usr/local/`.

**Note:** You really do need to install as `root`, system-wide.
A per-user installation to `$HOME` does not work as of Gnome 40, because Gnome shell doesn't load search providers from `$HOME` (see <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/3060>).

To uninstall use `sudo make uninstall`.
